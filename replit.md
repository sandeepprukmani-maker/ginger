# AI Browser Automation Agent

## Overview
This is an AI-powered browser automation agent that combines OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini with Playwright's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to enable natural language browser automation. Users can give instructions in plain English, and the AI will execute complex browser actions like navigation, clicking, form filling, and data extraction.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Flask web application (Python) serving a clean, modern UI
- **Backend**: 
  - Python Flask server on port 5000
  - OpenAI API integration for natural language understanding
  - MCP STDIO Client for communication with Playwright
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP Server (Node.js) running as a subprocess
  - Uses Chromium browser in headless mode
  - Communicates via JSON-RPC over stdio

```

## Configuration
- **OpenAI API Key**: Set in `config.ini` file under `[openai]` section's `api_key` field (fallback to `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable)
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini (configurable in config.ini)
- **Browser**: Chromium in headless mode
- **Server**: Runs on 0.0.0.0:5000

## Recent Changes
- 2025-10-20: GitHub Import Setup for Replit Environment + Critical Bug Fixes
  
  **Initial Setup:**
  - Created config.ini with sections for server, browser, and OpenAI settings
  - Installed Python dependencies via uv (flask, openai, requests, sseclient-py)
  - Installed Node.js dependencies via npm (playwright, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
  - Installed Playwright Chromium browser with headless mode support
  - Configured Flask workflow using `uv run python main.py` on port 5000
  - Configured VM deployment (stateful, always-running for MCP subprocess)
  - Changed port from 5002 to 5000 in main.py
  - Updated .gitignore to not exclude config.ini
  
  **Critical Bug Fixes (Post-Architect Review):**
  - **Security**: Removed hardcoded API key from browser_agent.py
  - **API Key Handling**: Updated to prioritize environment variables over config.ini for security
  - **OpenAI API Fix**: Changed `max_completion_tokens` to `max_tokens` (was causing API errors)
  - **MCP Client Fix**: Added stderr reader thread to prevent process deadlock
  - **CLI Args Fix**: Improved command-line argument handling for MCP server subprocess
  - **Error Messages**: Enhanced error messages to guide users toward secure practices
  
  **Verified**: Web interface, MCP subprocess communication, browser automation, export functionality

## Dependencies
**Python** (via uv):
- flask
- openai
- requests
- sseclient-py

**Node.js** (via npm):
- playwright
- playwright-core
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- @playwright/test

## API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Web interface
- `POST /api/execute` - Execute browser automation instruction
- `GET /api/tools` - List available browser tools
- `POST /api/reset` - Reset agent conversation history
- `POST /api/export-playwright` - Export last execution as Playwright code
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## How It Works
1. User enters a natural language instruction in the web UI
2. Flask server receives the instruction
3. BrowserAgent uses OpenAI to interpret the instruction
4. OpenAI decides which browser tools to call (navigate, click, fill, etc.)
5. MCPStdioClient spawns a Node.js subprocess running Playwright MCP
6. Playwright executes the browser actions
7. Results are streamed back to the UI in real-time

## Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional): OpenAI API key as environment variable (fallback if not in config.ini)
- `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_VALIDATE_HOST_REQUIREMENTS`: Automatically set to '1' by MCP client to skip browser dependency checks in Replit

## How to Set Your OpenAI API Key
You have two options:

**Option 1: Using config.ini (Recommended)**
1. Open the `config.ini` file
2. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key in the `[openai]` section:
   ```ini
   [openai]
   api_key = sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   model = gpt-4o-mini
   ```

**Option 2: Using Environment Variable**
1. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a Replit secret
2. The application will use it if config.ini doesn't contain a valid key

## Deployment Notes
- Deployed as a **VM** (always-running, stateful) because:
  - The MCP subprocess needs to maintain state
  - Browser sessions are persistent
  - Immediate response time is important
- The application runs on port 5000 (only non-firewalled port in Replit)
- Uses development Flask server (suitable for Replit environment)

## Export Feature

ðŸ“– **See EXPORT_GUIDE.md for complete documentation**

After successfully executing an instruction, an "Export as Playwright" button appears. This allows you to:

1. **Export as Playwright Test Code**: 
   - Generates a `.spec.ts` file with Playwright test code
   - Ready to use in your own Playwright test suite
   - Includes all successful actions (navigate, click, fill, etc.)
   - Download or copy to clipboard

2. **Export as JSON**:
   - Contains all steps with their arguments and results
   - Can be used for programmatic replay
   - Includes timestamp and original instruction

### Workflow: Record Once, Replay Fast

1. **Record (Slow)**: Use AI to figure out the automation steps
   - Example: "Go to example.com and click the login button"
   - AI navigates, finds elements, performs actions
   - Takes 10-20 seconds due to AI reasoning

2. **Export**: Click "Export as Playwright" button
   - Download the generated Playwright code
   - Or copy the JSON for programmatic use

3. **Replay (Fast)**: Run the exported code directly
   - No AI overhead
   - No MCP communication delays
   - Runs in < 1 second

This is perfect for:
- Creating test suites from manual exploration
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Learning Playwright syntax from AI-generated examples

## Known Limitations
- MCP subprocess communication requires process persistence (hence VM deployment)
- Browser runs in headless mode (no GUI visible to user)
- Maximum 10 iterations per instruction to prevent infinite loops
- Exported Playwright code may need selector refinement for dynamic content
