# Browser Automation Framework

## Overview
A comprehensive Python-based browser automation framework powered by Playwright and AI. This framework enables powerful browser automation for **any website** using natural language instructions via Model Context Protocol (MCP). Features intelligent error handling, learning capabilities, and automatic retry with corrections. Completely generic with no site-specific dependencies.

## Project Status
**âœ… FULLY OPERATIONAL + MCP INTEGRATED** - Successfully configured in Replit environment
- All dependencies installed and verified
- Playwright browser (Chromium) configured with system dependencies
- **NEW: Playwright MCP Server integration (@playwright/mcp) âœ¨**
- OpenAI API integration active
- Natural language automation tested and working via MCP

## Recent Changes (October 17, 2025)

**ðŸš€ Playwright MCP Server Integration:**
- Integrated Microsoft's official Playwright MCP server (@playwright/mcp@latest)
- Created PlaywrightMCPClient for standardized browser automation via Model Context Protocol
- Built MCP-powered natural language automation (nl_automation_mcp.py)
- MCP server provides 21 browser automation tools:
  - Navigation: browser_navigate, browser_navigate_back
  - Interaction: browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form, browser_select_option
  - Advanced: browser_drag, browser_hover, browser_file_upload
  - Analysis: browser_snapshot, browser_take_screenshot, browser_console_messages
  - Network: browser_network_requests
  - Management: browser_tabs, browser_close, browser_resize
  - Utilities: browser_evaluate, browser_press_key, browser_wait_for, browser_handle_dialog
  - Setup: browser_install
- AI (GPT-4) automatically selects and chains appropriate MCP tools for complex tasks
- Provides more robust and standardized automation than direct Playwright API
- Fixed NixOS environment issues for npx/MCP server compatibility

**Import to Replit Completed + Bug Fixes:**

## Usage Examples

### MCP-Powered Natural Language Automation (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the MCP-powered automation:
uv run python nl_automation_mcp.py

# Then type natural language commands:
# "Go to google.com and search for Python tutorials"
# "Navigate to github.com and click the login button"
# "Visit news.ycombinator.com and get the top 5 story titles"

# The AI will:
# 1. Use GPT-4 to understand your command
# 2. Select appropriate MCP browser automation tools
# 3. Chain multiple tools for complex tasks
# 4. Execute via Playwright MCP server
# 5. Provide clear feedback on progress
```

### Enhanced Natural Language Automation (Vision Mode)
```python
# Just run nl_automation.py and type instructions like:
# "Go to news.ycombinator.com and get the top 5 story titles"
# "Navigate to github.com and click the login button"
# "Visit example.com and extract all headings"

# The AI will:
# 1. Convert your instruction to browser actions
# 2. Execute them step by step
# 3. Learn from errors and retry automatically
# 4. Remember successful patterns for future use
```

### Basic Web Automation (Code)
```python
from src.automation import BrowserEngine, TaskExecutor
from src.automation.config import BrowserConfig, AutomationConfig

browser = BrowserEngine(BrowserConfig(), AutomationConfig())
executor = TaskExecutor(browser)

await browser.start()
await browser.navigate("https://any-website.com")
headings = await browser.get_all_text("h1, h2, h3")
links = await browser.get_all_text("a")
await browser.stop()
```

### AI Code Generation
```python
from src.automation import AITaskGenerator

generator = AITaskGenerator()
code = await generator.generate_playwright_code("Navigate to any website and extract all headings")
```

### Custom Automation (Any Website)
```python
browser = BrowserEngine()
await browser.start()
await browser.navigate("https://any-site.com")
await browser.fill("input[name='email']", "user@example.com")
await browser.click("button.submit")
data = await browser.get_all_text(".data-item")
await browser.stop()
```

## Environment Variables

Set environment variables using Replit Secrets:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional, required only for AI code generation features
- Other settings can be configured via BrowserConfig and AutomationConfig classes

## Known Limitations in Replit

- Playwright browser automation requires system dependencies that may need manual installation in cloud environments
- The framework code is fully functional, but actual browser execution may require additional setup
- All features work correctly in local development environments with Playwright dependencies installed
- AI code generation works if OPENAI_API_KEY is provided
