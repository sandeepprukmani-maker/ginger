- **Semantic Search**: Find similar tasks using AI embeddings
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live execution monitoring with progress streaming

## Intelligent Automation System

VisionVault uses a **Unified Automation Engine** that intelligently combines two powerful approaches:

### Adaptive Strategy Selection
The system automatically analyzes each task and chooses the best approach:

**üöÄ MCP Direct (Model Context Protocol)**
- **When used**: Simple tasks, single actions, high-confidence operations
- **How it works**: AI directly controls the browser via intelligent action planning
- **Advantages**: Fast execution, minimal overhead, real-time adaptation
- **Features**: Vision-based analysis, DOM scanning, fuzzy element matching

**üîß Code Generation (Playwright)**
- **When used**: Complex multi-step workflows, tasks requiring code review
- **How it works**: AI generates executable Playwright Python code
- **Advantages**: Full control, debuggable, reusable, modifiable
- **Features**: Self-healing, intelligent code reuse, semantic similarity matching

### Progressive Escalation
If the primary strategy fails, the system automatically escalates:
1. **First attempt**: Selected strategy (MCP or CodeGen)
2. **Healing**: DOM scanning ‚Üí Vision analysis ‚Üí Multi-strategy healing
3. **Alternative strategy**: Falls back to the other approach if needed
4. **Manual widget**: Headful mode allows manual element selection

### Continuous Learning
The system tracks which strategy works best for different task patterns and automatically improves its decision-making over time.

**Browser Modes**:
- **Headless**: Invisible browser, faster execution, ideal for background tasks
- **Headful**: Visible browser window, watch automation in real-time (requires local agent)

## Configuration

### Required API Keys (Optional but Recommended)
The application works without API keys but features are limited:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Enables AI code generation, MCP automation, and self-healing
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Enables semantic task search and embeddings
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Already configured for Flask sessions

**To enable full features:**
1. Click the "Secrets" tab in Replit
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key
3. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your Google AI API key

Without these keys, the app gracefully degrades:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI code generation disabled (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MCP automation disabled (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Semantic search disabled (requires GEMINI_API_KEY)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Intelligent planner disabled (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
- ‚úÖ Manual Playwright code execution still works
- ‚úÖ Teaching mode recording still works

### Workflows
- **Server**: Runs Flask application on port 5000
  - Command: `python run_server.py`
  - Serves web interface and API endpoints
  - Handles WebSocket connections for real-time updates

### Database
- SQLite database at `data/automation.db`
- Stores execution history, learned tasks, and task executions
- Automatically initialized on first run
- Vector embeddings stored in `data/vector_index.faiss`
