# Local-Only Browser Automation Setup

## Configuration Complete âœ“

Your Self-Healing Browser Automation System is now configured to run in **local-only mode** without requiring the browser-use cloud service.

## What Was Changed

### 1. API Key Configuration
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: âœ“ Required and configured - Powers the AI to understand natural language instructions
- **BROWSER_USE_API_KEY**: âœ— Not required - Bypassed by setting local-only mode

### 2. Browser Service Modifications

**File: `app/services/browser_use_service.py`**

Added local-only mode initialization:
```python
# Disable browser-use cloud telemetry and cloud requirements
os.environ['BROWSER_USE_LOGGING_LEVEL'] = 'INFO'
# Don't require cloud API key - use local mode only
if 'BROWSER_USE_API_KEY' not in os.environ:
    os.environ['BROWSER_USE_API_KEY'] = 'local-only-mode'
```

Configured Browser to use local Playwright:
```python
self.browser = Browser(
    headless=headless,
    disable_security=False,
    keep_alive=True,  # Keep browser alive for faster subsequent runs
    use_cloud=False   # Force local mode, don't use browser-use cloud service
)
```

## How It Works

### Local Mode Benefits
- âœ“ No cloud service subscription required
- âœ“ All browser automation runs on your Replit instance
- âœ“ Uses your local Playwright installation
- âœ“ Only needs OpenAI API key for natural language understanding
- âœ“ More private - your automation data stays local

### What You Can Do

You can now create browser automation tasks using natural language instructions:
- "Go to google.com and search for dogs"
- "Navigate to example.com and click the login button"
- "Go to github.com and search for browser automation"

### How It Processes Instructions

1. **Your instruction** â†’ 2. **OpenAI GPT** (understands what to do) â†’ 3. **Local Playwright** (executes browser actions) â†’ 4. **Results**

## Testing Your Setup

Try creating a simple task through the web interface:

1. Open the dashboard
2. Enter instruction: "go to example.com"
3. Choose headless or visible mode
4. Click "Execute with Healing"

The system will:
- Use OpenAI to understand the instruction
- Launch a local Playwright browser
- Navigate to the website
- Return the results

## Known Limitations

### Browser Launch Timeout (30s)
The browser-use library has a hardcoded 30-second timeout for browser startup. If you experience timeouts:

**On Replit (Linux):**
- Usually works fine as the environment is optimized
- First launch may be slower

**On Windows (Your Local Machine):**
- See `WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed solutions
- Main causes: antivirus scanning, slow file system
- Quick fixes: Use headless mode, add Playwright to antivirus exclusions

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables (automatically managed by Replit):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key          # Required - set via Replit Secrets
BROWSER_USE_API_KEY=local-only-mode         # Auto-set by code to bypass cloud
BROWSER_USE_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO              # Auto-set by code
```

## Cost Considerations

### OpenAI API Usage
- Each browser automation task uses OpenAI API calls
- Typical task: $0.001 - $0.005 per task (depending on complexity)
- Uses GPT-4o-mini model for cost efficiency
- Monitor usage at: https://platform.openai.com/usage

### Browser-Use Cloud
- **Not used** - You're running everything locally
- **No subscription required**
- $0 cost for browser-use service

## Troubleshooting

### "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"
- Go to Replit Secrets and verify the key is set
- Restart the application workflow

### "Browser launch timeout"
- Normal on first run (creating cache)
- Try again - subsequent runs are faster
- On Windows: See `WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### "Task execution failed"
- Check the task history in the dashboard
- Look at the error message for specific details
- Common causes: invalid instruction, timeout, network issues

## Upgrading to Cloud Mode (Optional)

If you later want to use browser-use cloud service for:
- Faster browser startup
- No timeout issues
- Managed browser infrastructure

Simply:
1. Sign up at https://cloud.browser-use.com
2. Get your API key
3. Add it to Replit Secrets as `BROWSER_USE_API_KEY`
4. Change `use_cloud=False` to `use_cloud=True` in browser_use_service.py

## Summary

âœ“ **Ready to use** - Create browser automation tasks now  
âœ“ **Local mode** - No cloud subscription needed  
âœ“ **OpenAI powered** - Natural language understanding  
âœ“ **Self-healing** - Automatically retries failed actions  
âœ“ **Cost-effective** - Only pay for OpenAI API usage  

Happy automating! ðŸš€
