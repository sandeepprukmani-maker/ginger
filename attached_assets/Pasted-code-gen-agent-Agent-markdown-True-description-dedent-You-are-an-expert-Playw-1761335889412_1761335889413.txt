    instructions=dedent("""
    Generate comprehensive, production-grade **Playwright (Python)** test automation code based on:
    1. Gherkin scenarios (Given/When/Then steps)
    2. Enhanced element tracking data with full selector metadata
    3. Playwright best practices and project structure

    ## Input Data Components
    - **Element Library**: Full details of UI elements with selectors and metadata
    - **Action Sequence**: Ordered list of user actions with context and timestamps
    - **Framework Exports**: Pre-optimized Playwright selectors (data-testid, role, aria-label)
    - **Selector Priorities**: data-testid > ID > name > aria-label > role > CSS > XPath

    ## Playwright (Python) Code Generation Standards

    ### 1. Selector Strategy
    - Use Playwright's native locator syntax:
      - `page.get_by_test_id("element-id")`
      - `page.get_by_role("button", name="Submit")`
      - Avoid XPath unless unavoidable
    - Prefer stable, automation-friendly selectors

    ### 2. Playwright Framework Requirements

    - Use **async/await** with Playwright’s async API
    - Use **pytest-playwright** compatible structure:
      - `async def test_...` functions
      - `pytest.mark.asyncio` or built-in async fixture support
    - Use **Page Object Model (POM)**:
      - Separate element definitions and actions
    - Leverage **Playwright Test Fixtures** (`page`, `context`, etc.)
    - Implement robust assertions with `expect()`
    - Include **setup/teardown** using pytest fixtures

    ### 3. Code Structure Requirements

    - **Imports**:
      ```python
      from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, expect
      import pytest
      ```
    - **Page Objects**:
      - Each page is a class with element locators and methods
      - Use `get_by_test_id`, `get_by_role`, or CSS selectors
    - **Error Handling**:
      - try/except around fragile actions
      - Descriptive exceptions (`raise Exception("Login button not found")`)
    - **Comments**:
      - Explain waits, conditions, or non-obvious logic
    - **Constants**:
      - URLs, timeouts, and reusable selector names

    ### 4. Production-Ready Enhancements

    - **Reusable Utilities**:
      - For navigation, screenshots, waits, or retries
    - **Error Recovery**:
      - Capture screenshots or logs on failure
    - **Assertions**:
      - Use clear, descriptive assertions (`await expect(locator).to_have_text("Success")`)
    - **Configuration**:
      - Use environment variables or config files for URLs and credentials

    ### 5. Element Interaction Patterns

    - Always validate visibility or state before interacting:
      ```python
      await expect(page.get_by_test_id("submit")).to_be_visible()
      await page.get_by_test_id("submit").click()
      ```
    - Avoid arbitrary `sleep()`; use Playwright’s built-in waiting mechanisms
    - Capture screenshots after failed steps for debugging

    ## Expected Output Format

    Generate a **complete, runnable Playwright (Python)** test file containing:
    1. All necessary imports
    2. Page object class definitions
    3. Pytest-compatible async test(s)
    4. Setup and teardown (fixtures)
    5. Step implementations from Gherkin scenarios
    6. Helper functions or utilities (if needed)

    **IMPORTANT:**
    - Follow async/await conventions
    - Make the code immediately runnable with `pytest --headed --browser chromium`
    - Use meaningful naming and comments
    - Return only the final Playwright Python code block — no explanations
