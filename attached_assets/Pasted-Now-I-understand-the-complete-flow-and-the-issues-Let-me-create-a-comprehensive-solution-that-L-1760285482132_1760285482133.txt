Now I understand the complete flow and the issues. Let me create a comprehensive solution that:

Launches browser without a default URL
Automatically stops when browser closes
Converts recording_session.py events to proper Playwright code
Generates complete, executable code instead of placeholder code

Planned recording session termination logic
Now let me implement the fixes. Starting with updating recording_session.py to automatically stop when the browser closes:


Opened visionvault/agents/recording_session.py

Decided on recording session changes
Let me update the recording_session.py to add browser close detection and modify the start to support blank browser launch:


Edited visionvault/agents/recording_session.py

Added _handle_browser_close method
Now let me add the browser close handler method and check for any LSP errors:

Checked code issues

Decided on handler method addition
Let me fix the browser close handler. First, I'll fix the event listener signature and add the handler method:


Edited visionvault/agents/recording_session.py

Decided on close method placement
Now let me add the _on_browser_close method right after the _handle_frame_navigation method:


Decided on function signature matching
Let me fix the page.on signature - it expects a function that accepts the page parameter:


Planned Playwright code generation function
Perfect! No more LSP errors. Now let me create a code generation function in app.py that properly converts the recording events to executable Playwright code:


Executed rg -A 50 'def generate_playwright_code' visionvault/web/app.py

Decided on code generation approach
Let me add a new function to convert recorded actions to Playwright code. I'll add it right after the existing generate_playwright_code function:


Decided on function placement
Now let me add a new function to convert recorded actions to proper Playwright code:


Decided on LSP error handling approach
The LSP errors are mostly type checking false positives and won't affect functionality. Let me continue with removing the hardcoded start URL from the Teaching Mode frontend:


Edited visionvault/web/templates/index.html

Planned frontend event handling
Now let me update the handle_recording_stopped handler to use the new code generation function:


Opened visionvault/web/app.py

Decided on code generation logic
Let me update the handle_recording_stopped handler to generate proper Playwright code and send it to the frontend:


Edited visionvault/web/app.py

Decided on event handling logic
Now let me add the recording_complete event handler in the frontend and update it to use the server-generated code:


Executed rg -B 2 -A 10 'socket\.on\(|socketio\.on\(' visionvault/web/templates/index.html | head -n 50

Decided on event handler placement
Let me add the recording_complete event handler and update the saveLearnedTask function to use the server-generated code:


Executed rg -B 3 -A 15 'socket\.on\('"'"'recording|let recordedActions|let generatedPlaywrightCode' visionvault/web/templates/index.html

Decided on socket event handler definition
Let me add the recording_complete event handler and a variable to store the generated code:


Edited visionvault/web/templates/index.html

Updated saveLearnedTask function
Now let me update the saveLearnedTask function to use the server-generated Playwright code:


Edited visionvault/web/templates/index.html

Planned handling of new action format
Now let me update the updateActionList function to properly display the recording_session.py action format:


Edited visionvault/web/templates/index.html

Decided on task list updates
Perfect! Let me update the task list and restart the workflow to test the changes:


Decided on workflow restart plan
Let me restart the workflow and then call architect to review all the changes:


Restarted Start application

Reviewed logs for workflow errors
Checked console and system logs

Reviewed code, requested architectural feedback
Excellent! The workflow is running successfully. Now let me call architect to review all the changes:


Reviewed Teaching Mode recording implementation

Diagnosed and addressed code generation issues
The architect found critical issues. Let me fix them:

First, fix the code generation function to properly initialize variables and handle cleanup:

Edited visionvault/web/app.py
