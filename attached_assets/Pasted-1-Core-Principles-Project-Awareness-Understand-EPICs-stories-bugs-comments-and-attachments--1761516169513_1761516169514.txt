1. Core Principles

Project Awareness

Understand EPICs, stories, bugs, comments, and attachments.

Maintain structured knowledge via embeddings in a vector database.

Continuous Learning

Learn from user feedback and corrections.

Update knowledge base incrementally, without retraining LLM.

Memory & Context

Remember previous conversations, decisions, and clarifications.

Provide consistent answers over time.

Conversational Q&A

Allow any question about your project.

Retrieve relevant project context + prior conversation memory.

Respond accurately and consistently.

3. Continuous Learning Implementation
A. Feedback & Updates

After each answer, the user can:

Accept

Edit / Correct

Reject

System stores this feedback as “validated knowledge” in the vector DB.

Future answers prioritize validated knowledge + prior answers.

B. Memory Across Sessions

Maintain conversation memory:

Store past chats, context, and clarifications.

Embed conversation history in vector DB for semantic retrieval.

Ensures consistent responses even across multiple sessions.

C. Incremental Knowledge Updates

Whenever project changes:

New EPICs, stories, attachments → embeddings added to vector DB.

Corrected or updated answers → update relevant chunks in vector DB.

AI can reference both project documents and previous answers for reasoning.

D. Knowledge Consistency

Use metadata tagging:

Source: Jira, Confluence, Attachment

Version: Document update timestamp

Feedback: User-approved corrections

LLM can refer to metadata to avoid contradicting previous knowledge.

4. Workflow for a Question

User asks a question.

System retrieves:

Relevant project chunks from vector DB.

Prior conversation memory and corrections.

Construct a prompt including:

Context chunks

Prior knowledge

Instructions to provide consistent answers

LLM generates response.

User validates / corrects response.

Feedback stored → updates knowledge base.

Future answers are more accurate and consistent.

5. Tools & Technologies
Component	Tech / Implementation
Vector DB	Pinecone / Weaviate / FAISS / Chroma
Embeddings	OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
Memory	Conversation history stored as embeddings
Feedback loop	Store edits/corrections in DB → feed into context retrieval
LLM	GPT-4 or GPT-4-turbo
Frontend	React + Chat UI for Q&A and feedback collection
Backend	Flask REST API + Scheduler for updates
6. Enhancements for “Super Memory”

Summarization for Context Management

Long conversations or EPICs → summarized periodically to keep memory manageable.

Source Referencing

Every answer includes references to Jira, Confluence, or file section.

Version Awareness

Tracks changes in EPICs, stories, or documents to avoid outdated answers.

Confidence Scoring

Highlight when AI is unsure; prompts user validation.

Automated Updates

Scheduler to automatically fetch and embed new Jira/Confluence content.

✅ Result:

The AI remembers everything relevant about your project.

Answers are consistent, context-aware, and updatable.

You can ask any question, correct it, and the AI learns from your feedback.

Works efficiently even for large projects with attachments
