# Import Migration Completed! üéâ

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Security Issue Resolved ‚úÖ
- **Removed hardcoded API key** from `main.py` line 147
- Now properly uses `os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")` to load from environment variables
- This prevents exposing your API key in the codebase

### 2. Code Generation Fixed ‚úÖ  
- **Improved history parser** to handle browser-use 0.5.9's `AgentHistoryList` structure
- Added `_extract_from_agent_history()` method to properly parse `AgentHistory` objects
- Enhanced verbose debugging output with `--verbose` flag
- Better error messages when actions can't be extracted

### 3. Environment Setup ‚úÖ
- Installed all Python dependencies via `uv`
- Installed Playwright Chromium browser
- Configured OpenAI integration with Replit Secrets

## Important: API Key Issue

There's an **old API key still cached** in the environment. Here's how to fix it:

### On Replit:
The new API key you added to Replit Secrets exists, but the old environment is still loaded.

**To refresh and use your new key:**
```bash
kill 1
```
This restarts the virtual machine and loads your new secret. Your workspace will reconnect automatically.

### On Your Local Windows Machine:
Since you're running this locally (based on your error logs), you need to update your local environment:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in your project root:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

2. **Or set environment variable** in PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
python main.py "go to example.com" --verbose
```

## How to Use

### Basic Usage:
```bash
# Simple automation
python main.py "go to example.com and tell me the page title"

# With code generation
python main.py "click the login button" --generate-code --output login.py

# With debugging
python main.py "fill out the form" --verbose --generate-code
```

### On Replit (recommended):
```bash
# Use uv run to ensure correct environment
uv run python main.py "your task here" --verbose
```

## Testing the Fixes

After you refresh the API key (using `kill 1` on Replit or updating .env locally), test with:

```bash
python main.py "open https://www.linkedin.com click Join Now" --generate-code --output linkedin.py --verbose
```

The `--verbose` flag will show you:
- ‚úÖ How many AgentHistory items were found
- ‚úÖ Which actions were extracted
- ‚úÖ Any parsing issues

## Expected Output

With the fixes, you should see:
```
üîç Parsing action history...
   History type: <class 'browser_use.agent.views.AgentHistoryList'>
   Found history attribute: X items
   ‚úì Extracted goto action
   ‚úì Extracted click action
‚úì Parsed 2 actions
‚úì Code saved to: linkedin.py
```

And the generated file should contain actual Playwright code, not just `# No actions to generate code from`.

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh environment** to load new API key
2. **Test code generation** with verbose flag
3. **Check generated files** to verify they contain code
4. **Report any issues** if code is still empty

## Files Modified

- `main.py` - Fixed API key loading
- `src/playwright_code_generator.py` - Fixed history parsing for browser-use 0.5.9
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies configured
- `.local/state/replit/agent/progress_tracker.md` - Import progress tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Empty Generated Files
- Make sure API key is valid and environment is refreshed
- Use `--verbose` flag to see what's being parsed
- Check that the task actually completed successfully

### API Key Errors  
- Run `kill 1` on Replit to refresh environment
- Check `env | grep OPENAI` to verify current key
- Make sure new key starts with `sk-` and is valid

### Windows asyncio Warnings
- These are harmless cleanup warnings on Windows
- They don't affect functionality
- Ignore messages about "I/O operation on closed pipe"
