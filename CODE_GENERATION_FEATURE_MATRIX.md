# Playwright Code Generation - Feature Matrix

## Overview

All automation engines now support automatic Playwright code generation! üéâ

## Engine Support Matrix

| Engine | Code Generation | Selector Quality | Best For |
|--------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| **Browser-Use (Basic)** | ‚úÖ YES | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent | AI-discovered selectors |
| **Browser-Use (Optimized)** | ‚úÖ YES | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent | Fast + AI-discovered |
| **Playwright MCP** | ‚úÖ YES | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Good | Tool-based automation |
| **Hybrid** | ‚úÖ YES | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent | Best of both worlds |

## How To Use

### Via API (Works with ALL engines)

```python
import requests

# Choose any engine!
engines = ['browser_use', 'browser_use_optimized', 'playwright_mcp', 'hybrid']

for engine in engines:
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/automation/execute',
        headers={'X-API-Key': 'your-key'},
        json={
            'instruction': 'Go to Google and search for Python',
            'engine': engine
        }
    )
    
    result = response.json()
    
    # All engines return playwright_code
    if 'playwright_code' in result:
        with open(f'{engine}_script.py', 'w') as f:
            f.write(result['playwright_code'])
        print(f"‚úÖ {engine}: Code generated!")
```

### Programmatic

#### Browser-Use

```python
from browser_use_codebase.playwright_code_generator import generate_playwright_code_from_history

# After running browser-use
history = await agent.run()
code = generate_playwright_code_from_history(history)
```

#### Playwright MCP

```python
from playwright_mcp_codebase.mcp_code_generator import generate_playwright_code_from_mcp_steps

# After running MCP automation
result = agent.execute_instruction("Search Google")
code = generate_playwright_code_from_mcp_steps(result['steps'])
```

## Engine-Specific Characteristics

### Browser-Use Engines

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ AI discovers working selectors automatically
- ‚úÖ Handles dynamic content excellently
- ‚úÖ 90%+ ready-to-run code
- ‚úÖ Best for exploration

**Generated Code:**
```python
# Selectors that AI actually used successfully
SEARCH_BOX = r"textarea[name='q']"
SEARCH_BUTTON = r"input[value='Google Search']"

await page.locator(SEARCH_BOX).fill("Python")
await page.locator(SEARCH_BUTTON).click()
```

### Playwright MCP Engine

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Clean tool-based automation
- ‚úÖ Direct mapping: tool calls ‚Üí Playwright code
- ‚úÖ Good for structured workflows
- ‚úÖ Deterministic steps

**Generated Code:**
```python
# Tool-based actions converted to Playwright
await page.goto("https://www.google.com")
await page.locator(INPUT_EMAIL).fill(email)
await page.keyboard.press("Enter")
```

**Note**: May include element references that need manual conversion:
```python
# Click element by reference (convert to specific selector)
# Original ref: e1
```

### Hybrid Engine

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Uses Browser-Use first (best selectors)
- ‚úÖ Falls back to MCP for reliability
- ‚úÖ Best overall code quality
- ‚úÖ Recommended for production

**Generated Code:**
Inherits from whichever engine successfully completed the task.

## Code Quality Comparison

### Selector Reliability

```python
# Browser-Use: Discovered selectors (Excellent)
LINK_SIGNIN = r"a[data-testid='signin']"  # AI found this works

# Playwright MCP: Tool-specified selectors (Good)
LINK_SIGNIN = r"a:text('Sign In')"  # MCP used this

# Both work, but Browser-Use tends to find more robust selectors
```

### Completeness

| Aspect | Browser-Use | Playwright MCP | Hybrid |
|--------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Navigation | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Clicks | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ö†Ô∏è May need ref conversion | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Form Fills | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ö†Ô∏è May need ref conversion | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Waits | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Comments | ‚úÖ Descriptive | ‚úÖ Tool-based | ‚úÖ Descriptive |

## Demo Scripts

### Browser-Use Code Generation
```bash
python examples/generate_playwright_code_demo.py
```

### Playwright MCP Code Generation
```bash
python examples/mcp_code_generation_demo.py
```

## Complete Example: All Engines

```python
import requests

instruction = "Go to GitHub trending repos and click the first Python repo"

# Test all engines
engines = {
    'browser_use': 'AI-Powered Browser-Use',
    'browser_use_optimized': 'Optimized Browser-Use (10X faster stopping)',
    'playwright_mcp': 'Tool-Based Playwright MCP',
    'hybrid': 'Hybrid Intelligence (Recommended)'
}

for engine_id, engine_name in engines.items():
    print(f"\n{'='*60}")
    print(f"Testing: {engine_name}")
    print('='*60)
    
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/automation/execute',
        headers={'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key'},
        json={
            'instruction': instruction,
            'engine': engine_id
        }
    )
    
    result = response.json()
    
    if result['success']:
        print(f"‚úÖ Success!")
        print(f"   Steps: {len(result.get('steps', []))}")
        
        if 'playwright_code' in result:
            print(f"   Playwright code: Generated ‚úÖ")
            
            # Save to file
            filename = f"generated_{engine_id}.py"
            with open(filename, 'w') as f:
                f.write(result['playwright_code'])
            print(f"   Saved to: {filename}")
        else:
            print(f"   Playwright code: Not generated ‚ùå")
    else:
        print(f"‚ùå Failed: {result.get('error')}")
```

## Advanced: Custom Code Generation

### Browser-Use Custom Generation

```python
from browser_use_codebase.playwright_code_generator import PlaywrightCodeGenerator

generator = PlaywrightCodeGenerator(
    history=agent_history,
    task_description="Custom automation task"
)

# Customize output
code = generator.generate_python_code(
    use_locators=True,        # Extract reusable locators
    include_comments=True,     # Add step comments
    async_style=True          # async/await (recommended)
)
```

### Playwright MCP Custom Generation

```python
from playwright_mcp_codebase.mcp_code_generator import MCPCodeGenerator

generator = MCPCodeGenerator(
    steps=mcp_steps,
    task_description="MCP automation task"
)

code = generator.generate_python_code(
    use_locators=True,
    include_comments=True,
    async_style=True
)
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Choose the Right Engine

- **New workflow?** ‚Üí Browser-Use (discovers selectors)
- **Known workflow?** ‚Üí Playwright MCP (faster)
- **Production?** ‚Üí Hybrid (reliable)
- **Not sure?** ‚Üí Hybrid (recommended)

### 2. Review Generated Code

Always review before production use:
- ‚úÖ Check selectors are specific enough
- ‚úÖ Verify waits are appropriate
- ‚úÖ Add error handling
- ‚úÖ Add assertions for tests

### 3. Enhance Generated Code

Use generated code as foundation:
```python
# Generated (starting point)
await page.locator(BUTTON).click()

# Enhanced (production-ready)
await page.locator(BUTTON).wait_for(state='visible')
await page.locator(BUTTON).click()
await expect(page.locator(SUCCESS_MSG)).to_be_visible()
```

### 4. Version Control

Commit generated scripts:
```bash
git add automation_scripts/
git commit -m "Add Playwright scripts for checkout flow"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No playwright_code in response"

Check:
1. Engine supports code generation (all do now!)
2. Automation completed successfully
3. Check logs for generation errors

### "Selectors not working"

- **Browser-Use**: Should work (AI-discovered)
- **Playwright MCP**: May need ref conversion
- **Solution**: Use Playwright Inspector to find better selectors

### "Code incomplete"

Some complex actions need manual implementation:
```python
# Generated comment:
# Scroll action (implement page.evaluate for scrolling)

# Implement:
await page.evaluate("window.scrollBy(0, 500)")
```
