# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Windows Setup Required

## YOU ARE SEEING THIS ERROR ON WINDOWS

The error you're seeing:
```
❌ Error: Both engines failed. Browser-Use: OpenAI API key must be set...
```

This means **you haven't set up the .env file on your Windows machine yet!**

## 🔑 Key Point

**The API key you configured in Replit Secrets only works IN REPLIT!**

Your **Windows computer** needs its OWN `.env` file with your API key.

## ✅ How to Fix This (Step by Step)

### 1. Create a `.env` file on your Windows computer

In the **same folder** where you have `main.py`, create a file named `.env` (not `.env.txt`!)

**Using Notepad:**
1. Open Notepad
2. Paste this content:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   SESSION_SECRET=my-secret-key-123
   CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
   ```
3. Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your real OpenAI API key
4. Click "File" → "Save As"
5. Change "Save as type" to **"All Files (*.*)"**
6. Name it: `.env` (with the dot at the start!)
7. Save it in your project folder (where `main.py` is)

**Using Command Prompt:**
```cmd
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env
```
Then edit it to add your actual API key.

### 2. Verify your setup

Run this test script to check if everything is configured correctly:

```bash
python test_engines.py
```

**If it passes:** ✅ You're all set! Run `python main.py`

**If it fails:** ❌ The script will tell you exactly what's wrong

### 3. Run the application

**OPTION A - Easy Way (Recommended for Windows):**
```cmd
run_windows.bat
```
This batch file ensures console logs appear properly and checks for the .env file.

**OPTION B - Manual Way:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**💡 IMPORTANT:** Keep the console window open while using the app! 
All automation logs will appear there when you click "Execute".

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

Run these diagnostic commands and send me the output:

```bash
# Check if .env file exists
dir .env

# Check what's in it (will show your key, so be careful sharing!)
type .env

# Run the environment checker
python check_env.py

# Test the engines
python test_engines.py
```

## 💡 Common Mistakes

1. **File named `.env.txt` instead of `.env`**
   - Windows hides extensions by default
   - Check: File Explorer → View → File name extensions

2. **No .env file at all on Windows**
   - The Replit environment variables don't transfer to your PC!
   - You MUST create a local .env file

3. **Wrong API key**
   - Make sure you're using YOUR OpenAI API key
   - It should start with `sk-` or `sk-proj-`

4. **File in wrong location**
   - The `.env` file must be in the same folder as `main.py`
   - Check with: `dir` command in your project folder

5. **No console logs appearing**
   - Use `run_windows.bat` instead of running `python main.py` directly
   - This ensures unbuffered output so logs appear immediately
   - Keep the console window visible while using the web app

## 📂 Your Project Folder Should Look Like This

```
your-project-folder/
├── .env                    ← YOU NEED THIS FILE!
├── .env.example           ← Template to copy from
├── main.py                ← Main app file
├── run_windows.bat        ← Easy launcher for Windows (ensures logs work)
├── check_env.py           ← Diagnostic script
├── test_engines.py        ← Engine test script
├── app/
├── browser_use_codebase/
└── ... (other files)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting: No Console Logs?

If you click "Execute" but don't see any logs in your console:

1. **Make sure you're using the batch file:**
   ```cmd
   run_windows.bat
   ```
   (Not `python main.py` directly)

2. **Keep the console window visible** - logs only appear in the console where you launched the app, not in the web browser

3. **The logs will show:**
   - When you start the app
   - Each time you click "Execute"
   - Every step the AI takes
   - Any errors that occur
