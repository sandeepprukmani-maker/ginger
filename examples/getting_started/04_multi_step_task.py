Getting Started Example 4: Multi-Step Task

This example demonstrates how to:
- Perform a complex workflow with multiple steps
- Navigate between different pages
- Combine search, form filling, and data extraction
- Handle a realistic end-to-end scenario

This is the most advanced getting started example, combining all previous concepts.

Setup:
1. Get your API key from https://cloud.browser-use.com/dashboard/api
2. Set environment variable: export BROWSER_USE_API_KEY="your-key"
