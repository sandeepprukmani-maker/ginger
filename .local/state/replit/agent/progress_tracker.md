[x] 1. Install the required packages
[x] 2. Restart the workflow to see if the project is working
[x] 3. Verify the project is working using the screenshot tool
[x] 4. Fix security vulnerability (remove hardcoded OpenAI API key)
[x] 5. Replace OpenAI embeddings with Gemini embeddings
[x] 6. Restart workflow and verify everything works
[x] 7. Inform user the import is completed and they can start building
[x] 8. Restored agent-based execution for headful mode
[x] 9. Fixed agent auto-detection of server port (was hardcoded to 7890, now auto-detects port 5000)
[x] 10. Implemented intelligent code reuse system (searches similar tasks, reuses code/locators via AI)
[x] 11. Comprehensive bug fix: Reduced 48 LSP diagnostics to 9 type-checker false positives
    - Fixed request.json None checks across all API endpoints (10+ locations)
    - Fixed undefined active_recorders and active_loops dictionaries
    - Added None checks for OpenAI responses and task lookups
    - Improved error handling throughout the system
    - All critical runtime bugs eliminated, system stable
[x] 12. Fixed localhost blocking issue when both server and agent run locally
    - Changed SocketIO async_mode from 'gevent' to 'threading'
    - Removed gevent monkey patching that was causing asyncio deadlocks
    - Server can now properly handle agent socket messages during automation execution
    - Execute Automation now works correctly in localhost-to-localhost mode
[x] 12. Final import verification - All packages installed and server running successfully
[x] 13. Mark import as complete and notify user
[x] 14. Fixed inject_element_selector to use advanced locator generation from playwright_codegen_2.py
    - Captures comprehensive element info (tag, text, id, classes, testId, role, ariaLabel, placeholder, alt, title, type, href, name, value)
    - Generates all possible locator types with scoring (testid: 1, role: 100, placeholder: 120, label: 140, alt: 160, text: 180, title: 200, CSS: 500+)
    - Verifies uniqueness of each locator (counts how many elements match)
    - Fixed regex-based selector extraction to handle attribute selectors correctly (was truncating input[type="text"])
    - Selects best UNIQUE locator with highest success rate
    - Falls back to best score if no unique locator found (with warning)
    - ✅ Architect approved: All locator types correctly extracted and verified for uniqueness
