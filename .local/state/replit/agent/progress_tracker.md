[x] 102. Fixed critical Playwright API bug (October 15, 2025)
[x] 103. Root cause: AI prompts instructed adding timeout to locator() calls
[x] 104. Error: "Page.locator() got an unexpected keyword argument 'timeout'"
[x] 105. Issue: Playwright 1.55 doesn't accept timeout in locator() - only in action methods
[x] 106. Fixed code generation prompt in visionvault/web/app.py
[x] 107. Fixed healing prompt in visionvault/services/healing_executor.py
[x] 108. Updated instructions: timeout only for actions (click, fill, etc.), NOT locator()
[x] 109. Added clear examples showing correct vs incorrect usage
[x] 110. ✅ Bug fixed - AI now generates correct Playwright API calls!
[x] 111. Fixed manual healing widget infinite retry bug (October 15, 2025)
[x] 112. Root cause: Manual healing was triggering unlimited attempts beyond max 5
[x] 113. Issue: Manual widget could be shown multiple times, creating "attempt 6, 7, 8..."
[x] 114. Fixed server-side: Changed attempt number to 999 with `final_manual_attempt` flag
[x] 115. Fixed agent-side: Agent now respects `final_manual_attempt` flag
[x] 116. Added checks: Agent won't send healing requests if final manual attempt fails

[x] 132. Fixed healing flow configuration (October 15, 2025 - 13:23 UTC)
[x] 133. Updated max_retries logic: After 2 AI healing attempts fail, manual widget now triggers
[x] 134. Server sends attempt=999 with final_manual_attempt flag to trigger user selection widget
[x] 135. User can now click on correct element after AI attempts are exhausted
[x] 136. Execution continues automatically after user selects the element
[x] 137. ✅ Healing flow optimized: 2 AI attempts → Manual widget → Execution continues
[x] 138. Fixed manual widget duplicate appearance bug (October 15, 2025 - 13:31 UTC)
[x] 139. Added widget_shown_for_test tracking to prevent widget from showing twice
[x] 140. Manual widget now shows only ONCE per test, even if replacement fails
[x] 141. If first manual selection fails to fix, test is marked as failed (no infinite widget loop)
[x] 142. ✅ Widget appearing only once - smooth user experience!

## Locator Replacement Fix (October 15, 2025 - 15:44 UTC)
[x] 143. Identified root cause: Quote variations prevent exact locator matching
[x] 144. Error shows: `page.locator("input[name=\"q\"]")` but code may have: `page.locator('input[name="q"]')`
[x] 145. Implemented flexible regex pattern matching for quote variations
[x] 146. New logic: Extract method + selector, build pattern matching both quote styles
[x] 147. Handles escaped quotes: `\"` and `\\'` variations now supported
[x] 148. Three-tier replacement strategy:
        1. Flexible pattern (handles quote variations)
        2. Exact match (fallback)
        3. String extraction (last resort)
[x] 149. ✅ Locator replacement now works regardless of quote format!

## Enhanced Locator Preservation (October 15, 2025 - 16:55 UTC)
[x] 161. Enhanced healing system to preserve working locators for non-locator errors
[x] 162. Error type detection now passed to code regeneration AI
[x] 163. For API/syntax/logic errors → AI preserves ALL existing locators, only fixes the code issue
[x] 164. For locator errors → AI improves only the failed locator, preserves working ones
[x] 165. Added explicit instructions to AI: "Do NOT modify working locators" for non-locator errors
[x] 166. Server restarted successfully with enhanced healing logic
[x] 167. ✅ Locator preservation implemented - working locators now safe from unnecessary changes!
[x] 168. Fixed error_type parameter passing bug (October 15, 2025 - 16:59 UTC)
[x] 169. Bug: error_type was showing as "unknown" instead of actual type (e.g., "api_misuse")
[x] 170. Fixed: Updated app.py to pass error_type parameter to regenerate_code_with_ai
[x] 171. Fixed: Updated healing_executor.py to extract 'error_type' instead of 'type' from context
[x] 172. Server restarted with fix applied
[x] 173. ✅ Error type now correctly passed to AI for proper locator preservation!

## Fixed Keyboard.press() Timeout Bug (October 15, 2025 - 17:01 UTC)
[x] 174. User reported: "Keyboard.press() got an unexpected keyword argument 'timeout'"
[x] 175. Root cause: AI was incorrectly adding timeout to page.keyboard.press()
[x] 176. Issue: Prompts didn't distinguish between locator.press() and keyboard.press()
[x] 177. Fixed code generation prompt: Clarified LOCATOR actions vs keyboard/mouse methods
[x] 178. Fixed healing prompt: Added explicit examples showing keyboard.press() needs NO timeout
[x] 179. Updated examples:
        ✅ CORRECT: await page.keyboard.press("Enter")  # NO timeout
        ❌ WRONG: await page.keyboard.press("Enter", timeout=5000)
[x] 180. Server restarted successfully
[x] 181. ✅ AI now correctly distinguishes keyboard/mouse methods from locator actions!
