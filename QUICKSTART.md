# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Browser Automation

## What You Have

A complete **Python-based browser automation system** that:
1. ✅ Takes natural language commands
2. ✅ Converts them to browser automation
3. ✅ Executes the automation
4. ✅ Generates reusable Python code

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add OpenAI Credits ⭐ IMPORTANT
Your OpenAI API key is already configured, but needs credits:

1. Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add payment method
3. Purchase credits ($5-10 is plenty to start)

### Step 2: Run Interactive Mode
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Enter Commands
```
➜ navigate to google.com and search for Playwright
➜ go to github.com and click explore
➜ open example.com and take a snapshot
```

## 📖 What Happens

1. **You say**: "navigate to google.com and search for AI"
2. **LLM plans**: Creates step-by-step automation plan
3. **System executes**: Runs browser automation via Playwright
4. **You get**:
   - ✅ Execution results (JSON)
   - ✅ Reusable Python code
   - ✅ Complete logs

## 📂 Your Output Files

### Generated Code (`generated_code/`)
Reusable Python scripts:
```bash
generated_code/automation_20241016_123456.py
```
You can run them directly or modify them!

### Results (`output/`)
Detailed execution logs:
```bash
output/results_20241016_123456.json
```

## 💡 More Examples

### Command Line Mode
```bash
python main.py "open wikipedia.org and search for Python"
```

### Run Pre-built Examples
```bash
python examples.py
```

### Test the System
```bash
python test_automation.py
```

## 🔧 System Architecture

    Results + Generated Code
```

## ⚠️ Current Status

✅ **Ready to Use:**
- Playwright MCP Server (running on port 3000)
- Python automation engine
- OpenAI integration
- Code generation

⏳ **Needs:**
- OpenAI account credits ($5-10 to start)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient quota" error
→ Add credits at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

### "Cannot connect to MCP"
→ MCP server should be running on port 3000
→ Check: `curl http://localhost:3000/`

### "No tools available"
→ Restart the MCP Server workflow
